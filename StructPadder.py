# Description: This module's purpose is to pad incomplete structures so that they are usable. It also sorts the
# structure's members into correct order by consequence.
# Refer to "__main__" if using this from the commandline.
# If using this in another program, make use of the Structure class!

# An entry represents one member in a C structure. One entry may look like this:
# "uint8_t someMember; // loc=0x04"
# It must consist of a type, name, and a location in the comments. Those propreties are defined in this class.
# If the StructMember is a structure itself, its size must be passed in structSize when initializing, as it cannot be
# determined through type context. (if it's a pointer to a structure, it doesn't count as a structure.)
# Note that the size of a structure MUST be a multiple of 8, as anything else isn't really possible in C

# pointers of all type are also allowed. Where the star is put does not matter. It can be put in both places,
# this program won't check for that. If it detects a star, it automatically associates the entry with a size of
